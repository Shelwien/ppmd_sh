# ppmd_sh9 By Eugene Shelwien.

ppmd_sh is a statistical compressor based on Dmitry Shkarin's ppmd vJr1 - More details here : http://compressionratings.com/i_ppmd.html

Basically ppmd is the only practical implementations of that method there were a few others, but they were severely limited by file size and had other quirks also ppmd is fairly fast its encoding is actually faster than lzma encoding, for example and at least text  compression is much better at that but its a symmetric method, so decoding has the same speed while lzma is much faster
